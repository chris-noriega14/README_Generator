## Description of README Generator:

The README Generator generates a professional README markdown file based off of the user's inputs in the terminal. 

This README Generator is initialized when the user types "node index.js" in the terminal. The terminal then asks the user a series of questions based off of the following topics:

•	Title of Application
<br>
•	Description of Application
<br>
•	Installation Instructions
<br>
•	Usage Details
<br>
•	Contributors to the Application
<br>
•	Test Process
<br>
•	Licenses Used
<br>
•	GitHub Username
<br>
•	Email Address
<br>
•	Programming Languages that you know
<br>
•	Contact Info if users have any questions about your application
<br>

The terminal then prints out a message of "Success!" and creates a README_NewApp markdown file with the user's inputs. The user then can open the file to display the full README file.

The README_NewApp.md file contains a Table of Contents with links to every section of the file for easier navigation. The file also displays a license badge based off of what the user chose as the response(ISC, MIT, Mozilla, GPU3).
